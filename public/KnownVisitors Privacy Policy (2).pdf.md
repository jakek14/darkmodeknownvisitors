This Policy also describes your rights and choices regarding your Personal Information. We do not control the privacy practices of our clients or other third parties who may use our Services on their websites, so their activities are not covered by this Policy.

# Collection of Personal Information

# Information You Provide

We collect Personal Information that you choose to provide to us directly. For example,when you sign up for an account, join our waitlist, request a demo, contact us with an inquiry, make a purchase, or participate in a promotion, you may provide information such as:

·Contact details: Name, email address, mailing address, phone number.

·Business information: Company or organization name and your role/title.

·Account credentials: Unique identifiers like a username and password (which you create), and an account ID or number.

·Payment information: Credit card number or other billing details when you purchase our Services.

·Any other information you choose to provide: For instance, information you send us via web forms, email, phone, or other communications (such as feedback or support requests).

We will indicate when certain Personal Information is required to use our Services. If you choose not to provide required information, you may not be able to access or utilize some features.

# Information Collected Through Cookies and Technology

Like many online services, we also collect certain information automatically through technological means when you interact with our Services. This helps us improve your experience and our offerings. For example:

·IP Addresses: When you visit our site, we collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address,which can indicate your general location and your internet service provider or network (e.g.company network).We use IP addresses to understand aggregate usage patterns (such as how often users visit certain pages), to help diagnose server issues, and to administer our website.

·Cookies: We use"cookies" (small text files stored on your device) and similar files or tags to remember your preferences and recognize you on repeat visits. For instance,cookies allow us to keep you logged in or tailor content to your interests, so you don't have to re-enter information each time. You can adjust your browser settings to refuse cookies or alert you when cookies are being set.Please note that if you disable cookies,some features of our site or Services may not function properly. (See the FTC's online guide on cookies and online tracking for more information.)

·Pixels and Web Beacons: Our website and the KnownVisitors tracking code (pixel)installed on our clients' sites may use pixel tags, JavaScript snippets, clear GIFs,or similar technologies to collect information about how users interact with pages and content. These tracking technologies help us analyze traffic patterns, such as how frequently specific site areas are visited and in what sequence.

·Device and Usage Information: We, together with our marketing and analytics partners (including service providers, advertising networks, and data partners), may automatically collect a variety of technical data from your computer or mobile device when you access our Services. This passively collected data may include, for example:your device's IP address; browser type and version (e.g.Chrome, Safari); operating system (e.g. Windows, macOS, iOS, Android); mobile network provider;device identifiers or advertising ID; device configuration and settings; the pages or screens you viewed on our site and the dates/times of access; the webpage that referred you to our site or the next site you visit after ours; the amount of time spent on pages; clickstream data about your navigation path and actions on our site; and information about how you interact with our emails or online ads (e.g.whether you opened an email or clicked a link). This data is generally collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies used by us and third parties. It helps us understand and improve user engagement,measure the effectiveness of marketing, and personalize content or advertisements.

·Location Data: If you access our Services via a mobile device or a browser that allowS location sharing, you may be asked for your precise geolocation. We (or our partners)will collect such location data only with your consent, and you can disable or adjust location sharing at any time in your device or browser settings.

Please note that cookies and the other tracking technologies we use do not themselves contain personally identifiable information like your name or email. However,they may uniquely identify your browser or device, and in some cases we (or our third-party partners) may combine the information collected through cookies with other data that does identify you. For example, data collected via a KnownVisitors cookie on a client's website might be linked with identifying information (such as an email address) obtained from our data partners in order to identify an otherwise anonymous visitor. Using such techniques, our Services help our clients learn the identities or contact details of visitors to their sites who would otherwise be anonymous. By using our Services (including when you visit a website that uses the KnownVisitors pixel),you acknowledge that we and our third-party partners may use cookies and tracking technologies to collect and combine data about you for the purposes described in this Policy.

Your Choices for Cookies: Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies or delete them. You may also use industry opt-out tools for interest-based advertising cookies (such as the Digital Advertising Alliance's opt-out page or the Network Advertising Initiative's site) to exercise choices about cookies set by many advertising networks. Please note that if you opt out of cookies or advertising trackers, our Services may still function, but your experience might be less personalized. Also, opting out via these mechanisms uses cookies themselves; if you clear all cookies, you may need to opt out again.

# Use of Personal Information

We use the Personal Information we collect for a variety of legitimate business purposes. These include:

·Providing and Improving Services: We use your information to deliver our Services to you and to fulfill the reasons you provided it. For example, we use Personal Information to set up and administer your account, to provide the visitor identification and analytics features you've subscribed to, and to process transactions or payments for service fees.We also use data (including usage data and feedback) to operate, protect, troubleshoot,and improve our platform and Services - this helps us refine our algorithms, enhance accuracy, and develop new features.

·Communicating with You: We may use your contact information to send you information and updates related to the Services. This includes sending requested materials (e.g. a report or whitepaper you asked for), responding to your inquiries or support requests, and sending administrative or account-related messages (such as confirmations, technical notices, updates,security alerts, or billing reminders). If you are on our mailing list, we may send newsletters or marketing emails about new products,services, or promotions that may interest you, but you can opt out of these marketing communications as described below.

·Marketing and Personalization: We may use Personal Information (and combine it with data collected via cookies and similar tools) to send or display personalized content and advertising to you. For example, we might use your data to tailor the ads you see on our site or on third-party sites,to recommend certain features, or to send you promotional emails that are more relevant to your interests. We may also use publicly available information from your social media profiles (such as your profile photo or listed interests) to better tailor our marketing or manage contacts. Any such usage will be done in accordance with applicable law and with respect for your opt-out choices.

·Analytics and Business Insight: We use aggregated and de-identified information about how users interact with our Services for analytics, research, and business development purposes. This helps us understand engagement levels, measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and make strategic decisions. For instance, we may analyze usage patterns to decide what new features to build, or review metrics to gauge the success of a marketing campaign.

·Service Providers and Third-Party Services: We sometimes employ or partner with third-party companies to perform functions on our behalf - for example, payment processing, data hosting,customer support tools, email/SMS delivery, or analytics services. We may need to share your information with these service providers in order for them to fulfill their functions (see Data Sharing below). In such cases,we use your data as necessary to enable these third parties to provide the requested product or service (e.g. to process a credit card payment or send an email you requested).These service providers are authorized to use your information only as necessary to provide services to KnownVisitors (and not for their own independent purposes), and they are required to protect your information in accordance with our instructions and applicable laws.

·Internal Business Purposes: We use information for our internal purposes such as auditing, quality control, and general business operations. For example, this includes financial record-keeping, audits,developing new products, training, and testing. We also use data for security purposes: to protect the Services and our users, prevent fraud,enforce our Terms of Service, and comply with legal obligations.

·Legal Compliance and Protection: If we believe it is necessary, we may use Personal Information to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, or legal processes.We may use your data to enforce our agreements (including our Terms of Service) and to protect the rights, property, or safety of KnownVisitors, our customers, our employees, or others (for example, to investigate misuse,fraud, or security incidents).

We may combine information we collect from you with information from other sources and use that combined information for any of the above purposes.

# De-Identified and Aggregated Data

We may remove or anonymize certain elements of your Personal Information so that it can no longer reasonably identify you, and then use or share such de-identified data freely. For example, we might aggregate usage data to compile statistics about how many visitors use our Services in a given month, or derive industry insights from trends across our client base. This aggregated or anonymized information is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and we may use it for any lawful purpose without further notice or obligation to you. In creating de-identified data, we will take reasonable measures to strip out or alter information (such as names or contact details) that makes it personally identifiable to you.

# Data Sharing and Disclosure

We are not in the business of selling or renting your information to unrelated parties for their own use. However, we do share Personal Information in the following circumstances in order to operate our business and provide our Services:

·With Our Clients: KnownVisitors provides a visitor intelligence and identification service. This means that if you are a visitor to one of our client's websites,the very purpose of our Service is to share information about you with that client (the website owner) to help them identify and understand their visitors. For example, if our tracking pixel collects your browsing activity on a client's site and our systems determine your email or other contact info (from our databases or partners), that VisitorData will be made available to that client through our dashboard or via an integration. In essence,we act as a service provider to our clients, processing and delivering Personal Information about their site visitors on their behalf. We license such Visitor Data to the client for their internal marketing and analytics use. Important: Our clients are independently responsible for handling the Visitor Data we provide to them in accordance with

applicable laws. (For example, they may need to disclose in their own privacy policies that they use a service like KnownVisitors to collect and identify visitor data.) If you have questions about how a particular website uses the information obtained through KnownVisitors, you should review that website's privacy policy or contact them directly.

·With Service Providers (Processors): We share Personal Information with trusted third-party vendors and service providers who perform services for us or on our behalf under strict confidentiality agreements. These third parties assist us with various business operations, such as:hosting our databases and infrastructure; sending out newsletters or transactional communications; processing payments; providing customer support tools; performing data analytics; or assisting in marketing efforts. For example, if you sign up for text message alerts, we may use an SMS delivery provider to send those messages (and in doing so we would provide your phone number to that provider). Similarly, if you click a link in one of our marketing emails, it may redirect through our email vendor's system to log the click. These service providers are authorized to use your information only as necessary to provide services to KnownVisitors (not for their own independent purposes), and they are required to protect your information in accordance with our instructions and applicable laws.

·Within Our Corporate Group: If KnownVisitors is part of a corporate group or has affiliates/subsidiaries, we may share Personal Information with our affiliated entities (for example, a parent company, subsidiary, joint venture, or other company under common ownership) for purposes consistent with this Policy. Any such entity will be required to honor the privacy protections of this Policy.

·Marketing and Advertising Partners: We may share certain data with partners in the digital advertisingecosystem in order to improve the reach and relevance of our marketing and our clients'marketing. For instance, we might share a hashed version of your email address or phone number with an advertising platform (like Facebook or Google) to determine if you are a known user on that platform. This can help us or our clients "retarget" you with ads or exclude you from certain campaigns. We and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to facilitate such matching and personalized advertising. We may also share information with data compilers or aggregators who help us enrich or verify the data we collect (for example, confirming if an email address is active,or appending additional demographic details about a contact). In all cases, we only share what is necessary for the intended purpose, and we contractually require partners to handle the information in compliance with applicable privacy laws.

·Business Transfers: If we merge with, acquire, or are acquired by another company,or if we sell all or a portion of our assets, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy or

insolvency, user information (including Personal Information) may be transferred as part of that transaction. This means your information could become subject to the privacy policy of the successor entity. However, if such an event occurs, we will strive to ensure that the new entity honors the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy and that you are given notice of any significant changes. Similarly, if we engage in a corporate partnership or joint venture, relevant information might be shared with those business partners under confidentiality agreements.

·Legal Compliance and Protection: We will disclose Personal Information when we have a good-faith belief that doing so is required by law or valid legal process, or when necessary to protect any person's rights, safety, or property. This includes, for example,responding to subpoenas, court orders, or government requests; reporting or preventing suspected fraud, illegal activity, or security issues; enforcing our Terms of Service or other agreements; or protecting the rights and safety of KnownVisitors, our employees,our clients, our users, or others. We may also disclose information to our attorneys,auditors, consultants, and others as needed for legal compliance and business purposes, provided they are bound to keep it confidential.

·With Your Consent or at Your Direction: Apart from the cases listed above, we will seek your consent before sharing your Personal Information with any third parties for purposes not described in this Policy. For instance, if we ever wish to post a customer testimonial that contains personal details, we would obtain your permission. Similarly, if you direct us to share your information with a third party (for example, if you use a feature to send a referral, or if you integrate KnownVisitors with another platform and data needs to flow to that platform), we will do so at your direction.

Please note that any third parties with whom we share data are obligated to handle it in accordance with relevant privacy laws. However, their own privacy practices may vary.This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of any third-party websites or services that are linked to our site or that integrate with our Services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any external sites you visit or services you use for more information on their data practices.

# Your Choices and Rights

We strive to provide you with control over your Personal Information. Depending on your relationship to KnownVisitors (for example, whether you are a client user or a visitor whose data we obtained) and your location, you have certain rights and choices regarding the information we hold about you:

# Access, Correction, and Deletion

If you have an account with us, you may access and update certain Personal Information directly by logging into your account settings. You may also request that we provide you with a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you, correct any inaccuracies, or delete your Personal Information, subject to certain exceptions. To make such a request, please contact us at the privacy email provided below.We will need to verify your identity before fulfilling access or correction requests.

In some cases, we may not be able to accommodate a request to change or delete information - for example, if we believe doing so would violate a law or legal obligation,or if the information is required to provide our Services or maintain the security and integrity of our systems. If we cannot fulfill a request, we will provide an explanation,subject to any legal restrictions. Please note that deleting your Personal Information may require the deletion of your user account with us, as certain data is necessary to maintain an account.

# Marketing Communications

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter or other marketing emails, you can opt out at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in those emails or by contacting us to request removal. Even after you opt out of marketing messages, we will still send you transactional or administrative communications that are relevant to your use of our Services (such as account notifications or customer service messages). If you have separately agreed to receive text message (SMS) notifications from us, you can reply "STOP" to any message to unsubscribe from further texts. Please note that after you opt out, it may take a short time for our records to reflect your preferences.

# Cookies & Tracking Choices

As described above, you have options to control or limit how cookies and similar technologies are used on your device (see the Information Collected Through Cookies and Technology section). You may also use browser settings or plug-in tools to block certain tracking scripts. If you do not want to be tracked by third-party analytics or advertising services, you can opt out via those services (for example, via Google's ad settings or the opt-out mechanisms of industry groups like the DAA or NAI).

Keep in mind that KnownVisitors does not respond to "Do Not Track" signals emitted by browsers, because there is no consistent industry standard for interpreting or honoring such signals. If a uniform standard for DNT is established in the future, we will update this section accordingly. In the meantime, the best way to limit online tracking is by using the opt-out methods described above.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100%o secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
